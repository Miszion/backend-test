# Backend Test- Restaurant Backend

## Description

This is a Node.js app that allows for fetching food information from a database. This app was written in Node.js with an SQL database configuration.

## Getting Started

For this project, a database url with appropriate login information is needed. Please request this from me specifically if you want to test this out for yourself. The database used is configured specifically for getting food information, votes, and images. 

1. Make sure you have node installed on your local machine.
2. run `node server.js` to host the API on your localhost.
3. This code can be used in combination with the restaurant-vote-frontend repo located at https://github.com/Miszion/restaurant-vote-frontend
